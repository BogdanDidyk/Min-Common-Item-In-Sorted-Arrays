# Min Common Item In Sorted Arrays
This code implements an algorithm for finding the minimum common element of three sorted arrays.

## Example
Suppose we have the following arrays. Need to find minimum common element:

[1, 1, 2, 3, **4**, 4, 4, 8, 8, 9]  
[0, 1, **4**, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9]  
[0, 2, **4**, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]

Obviously, the minimum number is 4.
